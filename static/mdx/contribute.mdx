### Add a Paper

The CryptoPapers team is currently one person working in their free time, so the site is undoubtedly missing many great papers. If you would like to add a paper to the collection head over to our [GitHub page](https://github.com/crypto-papers) and follow the instructions for submitting a pull request.

If you do not want to submit a pull request, but would still like to suggest a paper for inclusion, please tweet [@crypto_papers](https://twitter.com/crypto_papers) with your recommendation and a link to the paper.

### Site Enhancements

We would also like to hear from you if you spot any bugs, errors, or areas for improvement. Again, please submit a detailed issue report at our [GitHub page](https://github.com/crypto-papers) or shoot a tweet over to [@crypto_papers](https://twitter.com/crypto_papers).

### Donations

The CryptoPapers project fulfils a personal interest and serves as a learning opportunity. I never intended, nor do I expect, to make money off of the venture. That said, webhosting ain't free and I've invested a fair bit of time in tracking down and including the papers in the library. If you enjoy the site and are feeling super generous, please consider contributing a little bit to one of the following addresses:
